# Reimplement-STEM
Re-implementation of AAAI-22 STEM: Unsupervised Structural Embedding for Stance Detection. 
The provided [code](https://github.com/NasLabBgu/STEM) by the paper authors cannot run and lacks core components. I re-implemented these components and successfully re-produced the demonstrated results in the paper.

THE CODE's UGLY AS HELL, BUT IT FREAKING WORKS!
