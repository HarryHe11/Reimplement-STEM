# Reimplement-STEM
Re-implementation of AAAI-22 paper: "STEM: Unsupervised Structural Embedding for Stance Detection." 

The [code](https://github.com/NasLabBgu/STEM) provided by the authors was non-functional and was missing essential components. However, I managed to re-implement these components myself.
Although I must admit that the codes are not well-organized, it is fully functional and achieves the desired outcomes.
