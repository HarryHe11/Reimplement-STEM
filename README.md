# Reimplement-STEM
Re-implementation of AAAI-22 paper: "STEM: Unsupervised Structural Embedding for Stance Detection." 

The [code](https://github.com/NasLabBgu/STEM) provided by the authors was not working, missing essential components. 

I managed to re-implement these components myself. The codes are not well-organized, but it works functional and reproduced the reported results in the paper.
